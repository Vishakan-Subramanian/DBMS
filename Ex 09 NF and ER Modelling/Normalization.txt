COMPANY(empid, name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno, dname, mgr_id, pno, pname, pdno, hrs)

FD1 : empid -> name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno
FD2 : dno -> dname, mgr_id
FD3 : pno -> pname, pdno
FD4 : empid, pno -> hrs

Finding the Primary Key of the COMPANY relation

{empid}+	: {empid, name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno, dname, mgr_id}
{dno}+		: {dno, dname, mgr_id}
{pno}+		: {pno, pname, pdno}
{empid, pno}+	: {empid, name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno, dname, mgr_id, pno, pname, pdno, hrs}

The closure of {empid, pno} contains all the attributes of the relation	

Key Attributes of the Company Relation : empid, pno

1NF Normalization

The relations are already in 1NF form as there are no multi-valued
attributes or composite attributes.

2NF Normalization

Since the attributes pname, pdno are non-key attributes that are not dependent upon empid
and the attributes name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno, dname, mgr_id are not dependent upon pno,
we split them into 2 relations EMPLOYEES and PROJECT, with pno and empid their respective key attributes.

Also, the hrs attribute is completely dependent upon the key attributes, those 3 attributes comprise
another relation namely PROGRESS, with the empid and pno being the key attributes. 
Empid and pno are also foreign keys which are referenced from the EMPLOYEES and PROJECT relations.

Now, the relations are in 2NF.

EMPLOYEES	(empid, name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno, dname, mgr_id)
PROJECT		(pno, pname, pdno)
PROGRESS	(empid, pno, hrs)

3NF Normalization

Since dname, mgr_id of EMPLOYEES relation are transitively dependent upon empid through dno, 
they have to be broken down, as 3NF disallows transitive dependency. Dno is also referenced
as a foreign key in EMPLOYEES relation from the DEPARTMENTS relation where it is a key attribute.

Now, the relations are in 3NF.

EMPLOYEES	(empid, name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno)
DEPARTMENTS	(dno, dname, mgr_id)
PROJECT		(pno, pname, pdno)
PROGRESS	(empid, pno, hrs)

FDs in 3NF form:

FD1 : empid -> name, address, bdate, sex, salary, dno
FD2 : dno -> dname, mgr_id
FD3 : pno -> pname, pdno
FD4 : empid -> pno, hrs


Performing UNION on the 3NF FDs:
